  abstract = {The relationship between composition and plasmonic properties in noble metal nanoalloys is still largely unexplored. Yet, nanoalloys of noble metals, such as gold, with transition elements, such as iron, have unique properties and a number of potential applications, ranging from nanomedicine to magneto-plasmonics and plasmon-enhanced catalysis. Here, we investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance at the level of the single Au-Fe nanoparticle by applying a strategy that combines experimental measurements using near field electron energy loss spectroscopy with theoretical studies via a full wave numerical analysis and density functional theory calculations of electronic structure. We show that, as the iron fraction increases, the plasmon resonance is blue-shifted and significantly damped, as a consequence of the changes in the electronic band structure of the alloy. This allows the identification of three relevant phenomena to be considered in the design and realization of any plasmonic nanoalloy, specifically: the appearance of new states around the Fermi level; the change in the free electron density of the metal; and the blue shift of interband transitions. Overall, this study provides new opportunities for the control of the optical response in Au-Fe and other plasmonic nanoalloys, which are useful for the realization of magnetoplasmonic devices for molecular sensing, thermo-plasmonics, bioimaging, photocatalysis, and the amplification of spectroscopic signals by local field enhancement.},

Although the nucleation of the nanoparticles is almost isotropic, their growth is strongly anisotropic resulting in a sharp dependence of their optical transmittance on the orientation of the polarization of the incident light. We show that both the frequency and the spectral width of the transverse and longitudinal surface plasmon resonances can be easily tuned by varying the amount of deposited metal. Such nanostructured materials open perspectives for the development of plasmonic devices endowed with tunable optical dichroism both in the visible and the near infrared regimes.},

The commonly employed metals, Au and Ag, yield plasmon resonances only spanning the visible/near-infrared range. Stretching upward, the useful energy range of plasmonics requires exploiting different materials. Deep-ultraviolet plasmon resonances happen to be achievable with one of the cheapest and most abundant materials available: aluminum indeed holds the promise of a broadly tunable plasmonic response, theoretically extending far into the deep-ultraviolet. Complex nanofabrication and the unavoidable Al oxidation have so far prevented the achievement of this ultimate high-energy response. A nanofabrication technique producing purely metallic Al nanoparticles has at last allowed to overcome these limits, pushing the plasmon resonance to 6.8 eV photon energy ({$\approx$}180 nm) and thus significantly broadening the spectral range of plasmonics' numerous applications.},

Oxygen coverages varying from a quarter to two monolayers (MLs) are considered. At a 1/4 ML coverage, the most stable on-surface adsorption sites are the twofold long bridge sites on the (1 1 0), and the fourfold-hollow sites on the (1 0 0) surface. The presence of on-surface oxygen atoms enhances the magnetic moments of the atoms of the two topmost Fe layers. Detailed results on the surface magnetic properties, due to O incorporation, are presented as well. Subsurface adsorption is found unfavored. The most stable subsurface O, in tetrahedral positions at the (1 0 0) and octahedral ones at the (1 1 0) surface, are characterized by substantially lower binding than that in the on-surface sites. Subsurface oxygen increases the interplanar distance between the uppermost Fe layers. The preadsorbed oxygen overlayer enhances binding of subsurface O atoms, particularly for tetrahedral sites beneath the (1 1 0) surface.},

Recent breakthroughs in XAFS analysis show that there exist significant discrepancies between theoretical and experimental IMFP values, and that this can significantly impact upon extraction of other key structural parameters from both XANES and XAFS. Resolution of these discrepancies is required to validate experimental studies of material structures, and is particularly relevant to the characterization of small molecules and organometallic systems for which tabulated electron scattering data is often sparse or highly uncertain.},

Femtosecond laser radiation with wavelength around 400 nm (photon energy 3.1 eV) was used for excitation. The metal aggregates have linear dimensions in the range between 40 nm and several 100 nm. It is shown that the two-photon photoemission spectra of the Cu and Ag nanoclusters reveal the same qualitative differences from the spectra of the corresponding homogeneous and clean metal surfaces. In particular, they show an enhanced photoemission yield (up to 70 times higher) and present a different overall shape, characterized by differences around the Fermi level onset and a steeper intensity increase at lower final state energies. These differences are discussed in terms of the excitation of localized surface plasmons in the clusters and a resulting modification of the near-zone electromagnetic field, which in turn influences the two-photon photoemission and its dynamics. Moreover, it is shown that a positive unit charge (photohole) resides on the clusters during the timescale relevant for the two-photon photoemission process.},

We present a microscopic and spectroscopic study of the plasmonic response in single-crystalline Ag wires grown in situ on Si(001) substrates. Excitation of the plasmonic modes with broadly tunable (UV-IR) femtosecond laser pulses excites ultrafast multiphoton photoemission, whose spatial distribution is imaged with an aberration-corrected photoemission electron microscope, thereby providing a time-integrated map of the locally enhanced electromagnetic fields. We show by tuning the wavelength, polarization, and k-vector of the incident laser light that for a few micrometers long wires we can selectively excite either the propagating surface plasmon polariton modes or high-order multipolar resonances of the Ag/vacuum and Ag/Si interfaces. Moreover, upon tuning the excitation wavelength from the UV to the near-IR spectral regions, we find that the resonant plasmonic modes shift from the top of the wires to selvedge at the Ag/Si interface. Our results, supported by numerical simulations, provide a better understanding of the optical response of metal/semiconductor structures and guidance toward the design of polaritonic and nanophotonic devices with enhanced properties, as well as suggest mechanisms for plasmonically enhanced photocatalysis.},

Both the linearly and circularly polarized femtosecond light pulses excite spatially asymmetric 2PP yield distributions, which are imaged. We attribute the asymmetry for linearly polarized light to the relative alignments of the laser polarization and triangle edges, which affect the efficiency of excitation of the longitudinal component of the SPP field. For circular polarization, the asymmetry is caused by matching of the spin angular momenta (SAM) of light and the transverse SAM of SPPs. Moreover, we show that the interference patterns recorded in the 2P-PEEM images are cast by phase shifts and amplitudes for coupling of light into the longitudinal and transverse components of SPP fields. While the interference patterns depend on the excitation polarization, nanofemto movies show that the phase and group velocities of SPPs are independent of SAM of light in time-reversal invariant media. Simulations of the wave interference reproduce the polarization and spin-dependent coupling of optical pulses into SPPs.},

  abstract = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are fundamental collective charge density excitations at surfaces of solid-state plasmas. They can energize physical and chemical processes at the nanoscale, but control of the spatiotemporal evolution of their energy, momentum, and spin is necessary to effectively transfer their quantum properties to molecules and other nanoscopic objects. Thus, to design the coupling of SPPs into other modes of an electronic system, it is important to describe and control their nanofemto spatiotemporal distributions. We investigate the spatial SPP field and spin distributions when launched by illuminating a converging lens coupling structure in an Ag film with obliquely incident linearly or circularly polarized femtosecond light pulses. The propagation and focusing of SPPs are recorded as movies by scanning the pump-probe pulse delay and recording the evolving interference patterns between the SPP and optical fields by ultrafast interferometric time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. The observed PEEM images of SPPs for p-polarized excitation light are symmetric with a distinct focal spot, but with circularly polarized excitation the coupling structure also acts as a plasmonic spin-Hall device exhibiting light helicity dependent asymmetric launching and focusing with respect to the optical plane. We show that the anisotropy arises because the SPP excitation efficiency depends on matching of the spin angular momenta between the incident vacuum light and the SPP field. Because the coupling structure generates distinct plasmonic field texture, the generated chiral density of the SPP field is spatially dependent on the focusing conditions and helicity of the excitation light. We demonstrate that the SPP fields excited by circularly polarized light (CPL) converge to a focal point of high chiral density with the location and sign defined by the light-helicity, which can be utilized to design and enhance quantum interactions with chiral objects, such as molecules.},

At low temperature, a fast substrate coverage is achieved due to the reduced mobility which, on the other hand, inhibits the development of an atomically smooth surface. In this study we used a controlled procedure to grow smooth epitaxial films of a few nanometres of Fe on MgO (001). The development of the dynamic conductivity as a measure of morphological roughness was observed during metal deposition by means of in-situ infrared spectroscopy. At various steps of thin-film preparation we used low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) for a characterisation of the crystalline surface quality. With ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) we investigated the surface topology of the prepared films with respect to smoothness. For example, for a controlled-growth 2-nm film, we observed a sharp LEED pattern and a metallic dynamic conductivity, and we did not find the distinct grooves which are characteristic of a granular structure.},

In our model, the circular dichroism (CD) signal comes from the Coulomb interaction between NPs. We show that the CD spectrum is very sensitive to the geometry and composition of a chiral complex and also has typically both positive and negative bands. In our calculations, the strongest CD signals were found for the helix geometry resembling helical structures of many biomolecules. For chiral tetramers and pyramids, the symmetry of a frame of a complex is very important for the formation of a strong CD response. Chiral natural molecules (peptides, DNA, etc.) often have strong CD signals in the UV range and typically show weak CD responses in the visible range of photon energies. In contrast to the natural molecules, the described mechanism of plasmonic CD is able to create strong CD signals in the visible wavelength range. This plasmonic mechanism offers a unique possibility to design colloidal and other nanostructures with strong optical chirality.},

For kinetic energies below 50 eV, very few data exist in the literature, although this energy range is vital for electron spectroscopy using low-energy electrons, e.g., for studying the valence electronic band structure. Extremely short attenuation lengths are expected for the transition metals gadolinium and terbium. To determine the electron attenuation length in these materials, we conducted inverse-photoemission overlayer experiments with ultrathin Gd and Tb films on W(110). For 10-eV electrons, we find an attenuation length of about one monolayer in Gd and even less in Tb, i.e., two thirds (or more) of the electrons are stopped by only one monolayer. These results imply extremely short information depths for electron spectroscopies with low energies on the lanthanides Gd and Tb.},

We predict that AOS should be possible with as little as 0.5\% of MCD, after a minimum number of laser shots heat the sample close to the Curie temperature. Finally, we qualitatively reproduce the all-optically switched domain patterns observed experimentally by numerically simulating the result of multiple laser shots on an FePtC granular ferromagnetic film.},

  abstract = {Ultrafast optical heating of the electrons in ferrimagnetic metals can result in all-optical switching (AOS) of the magnetization. Here we report quantitative measurements of the temperature rise of GdFeCo thin films during helicity-independent AOS. Critical switching fluences are obtained as a function of the initial temperature of the sample and for laser pulse durations from 55 fs to 15 ps. We conclude that nonequilibrium phenomena are necessary for helicity-independent AOS, although the peak electron temperature does not play a critical role. Pump-probe time-resolved experiments show that the switching time increases as the pulse duration increases, with 10 ps pulses resulting in switching times of {$\sim$}13 ps. These results raise new questions about the fundamental mechanism of helicity-independent AOS.},

  abstract = {Electron energy loss spectra (ELS) have been obtained from Ni metal, NiO and NiO after surface reduction by 2 keV Ar+ bombardment. Two predominant loss features in the ELS spectra obtained from Ni metal are assigned as the surface and bulk plasmon excitations, and numerous other features arising from single electron transitions from both the bulk and surface Ni 3d bands to higher-lying conduction bands are also present. The surface and bulk ELS features have been unambiguously identified in this study by varying the primary beam energy. The peak assignments are based on a multitude of reported data on the electronic structure of Ni and NiO obtained using several different techniques, ranging from theoretical calculations to optical measurements and previous experimental ELS data. The ELS spectra obtained from NiO are markedly different than the Ni metal spectra as expected. The fact that the NiO spectral features do not vary appreciably with primary beam energy Ep indicates that the surface electronic structure is similar to that of the bulk solid. Although most of the loss features from NiO can be attributed to interband transitions originating from the O 2p and Ni 3d states, the major peak centered at a loss energy of about 22.0 eV may be due to a collective excitation of the valence electrons. As expected, the ELS spectra obtained from the sputtered NiO surface exhibit characteristic features from both metallic Ni and NiO, with the metallic features becoming more prominent with increasing sputtering time. The most distinct change in the ELS spectra following reduction is the growth of the surface plasmon peak at 6.0 eV due to the presence of metallic Ni in the near-surface region. The loss features characteristic of bulk Ni metal are not as pronounced in the spectra obtained from the reduced NiO. These observations indicate that the metallic Ni formed during Ar+ bombardment is confined to the very near-surface region, and they also demonstrate that ELS is sensitive to differences in the properties of thin metallic films or clusters and bulk Ni metal. The present results demonstrate that ELS can be used to distinguish between metallic nickel and NiO on the sputtered NiO surface.},

Explicit expressions are obtained for the spin-polarization vector of the photoelectrons, and the spin-averaged intensity and its change upon reversal of the magnetization direction, i.e. magnetic dichroism, for circularly and linearly polarized incident light. These results firstly elucidate the origin of spin polarization and dichroism in terms of an interplay between spin\textendash orbit coupling and exchange, and secondly provide a systematic overview of possible effects. In particular, we predict new types of magnetic linear dichroism for s-polarized light in the case of magnetization perpendicular to surfaces with a twofold rotation axis and in the case of in-plane magnetization of fcc (111) or hcp (0001) surfaces.},

In general set-ups (light polarization, incidence and emission directions, magnetization direction), dichroism is either due to change of the light polarization or due to magnetization reversal, or due to both. Relations between photoemission intensities for different set-ups lead to the definition of asymmetries in order to probe the origin of the dichroism. Numerical relativistic photoemission calculations provide quantitative results for prototypical systems: Ni/Cu(001) with perpendicular magnetization, Co/Cu(001) with in-plane magnetization, and non-magnetic Cu(001). ᭧ 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Femtosecond laser pulses, which are tunable from 440 to 990 nm, are generated at MHz repetition rates by noncollinear parametric amplification (NOPA). The pulses have durations of 20 to 30 fs over the major part of the tuning range and a high energy stability of 1.3\% (rms). The NOPA is pumped with ultraviolet pulses from the third harmonic of an ytterbium doped fiber laser system and seeded by a smooth continuum generated in bulk sapphire. The residual second harmonic is used to pump an additional NOPA, which is independently tunable from 620 to 990 nm. Interference experiments show that the two NOPA systems have a precisely locked relative phase, despite of being pumped by different harmonics with a random phase jitter. This demonstrates that the phase of pulses generated by optical parametric amplification does not depend on the pump phase.},

The sulfur/oxygen coverage is considered from a quarter of one monolayer (ML) to a full monolayer. The work function change, magnetic properties, and density of states are determined and compared. We find that the work function increases with sulfur coverage in agreement with experiment. We also find that sulfur interacts strongly with the surface layer and that the magnetic moment of the Fe surface decreases as the sulfur coverage increases. In the case of oxygen adsorption, we find that the magnetic moment of the surface Fe atoms instead increases. We show that the difference in surface magnetic moment between sulfur adsorption and oxygen adsorption can be simply explained combining the Slater-Pauling rigid band model linking doccupation and magnetic moment with an electronegativity argument. Moreover, the work function of the Fe surface as a function of oxygen coverage is found to be very sensitive to overlayer arrangement, here seen in the cases of 0.5 ML c(2 \texttimes{} 2) and 0.5 ML p(2 \texttimes{} 1). This is shown to result from large differences in the surface dipole moment change induced by the oxygen adsorption in the two different overlayer arrangements.},

It is shown that femtosecond (fs) light pulses induce magnetization reversal in a large variety of magnetic materials. However, so far, only GdFeCo-based ferrimagnetic thin films exhibit magnetization switching via a single optical pulse. Here, the single-pulse switching of Co/Pt multilayers within a magnetic spin-valve structure ([Co/Pt]/Cu/GdFeCo) is demonstrated and four possible magnetic configurations of the spin valve can be accessed using a sequence of single fs light pulses. The experimental study reveals that the magnetization final state of the ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] layer is determined by spin-polarized currents generated by the light pulse interactions with the GdFeCo layer. This work provides an approach to deterministically switch ferromagnetic layers and a pathway to engineering materials for opto-magnetic multi-bit recording.},

However, the number of significant digits in the values obtained through thermionic-, field- and photo-emission techniques is typically just two or three. Here, we show that the number can go up to five when angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is applied. This owes to the capability of ARPES to detect the slowest photoelectrons that are directed only along the surface normal. By using a laser-based source, we optimised our setup for the slow photoelectrons and resolved the slowest-end cutoff of Au(111) with the sharpness not deteriorated by the bandwidth of light nor by Fermi-Dirac distribution. The work function was leveled within ~{$\pm$}0.4 meV at least from 30 to 90 K and the surface aging was discerned as a meV shift of the work function. Our study opens the investigations into the fifth significant digit of the work function.},

  abstract = {The effective attenuation length (EAL) is a useful parameter in quantitative applications of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This parameter is used in place of the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) in expressions for different XPS applications to correct those expressions for elastic scattering of the photoelectrons. We consider expressions used to determine (i) the thickness of an overlayer film on a planar substrate, (ii) the surface composition, (iii) the depth of a thin marker or delta layer, and (iv) the shell thickness of a core\textendash shell nanoparticle. An EAL can be used for each of these applications. In general, the EAL depends on the particular defining equation as well as on the XPS configuration. Many attempts were made in the 1970s and 1980s to measure EALs for the determination of overlayer-film thicknesses, but there were often wide scatters in the reported results due to the difficulty in preparing uniform films with known thicknesses. We have therefore been motivated to calculate EALs for each application. The SRD 82 database from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides EALs for the measurement of overlayer-film thicknesses and of marker-layer depths. These EALs can be determined for photoelectron energies between 50 eV and 2 keV and for user-specified XPS configurations. We review EAL predictive equations for the determination of overlayer-film thicknesses on a planar substrate for XPS with unpolarized x rays and with linearly polarized x rays as well as an EAL predictive equation for quantitative analysis by XPS. These equations are simple analytical expressions that are valid for well-defined ranges of experimental conditions and for useful ranges of electron energies. We also point out that EALs for the determination of overlayer-film thicknesses can be derived from the simulated photoelectron intensities obtained from the NIST Database for the Simulation of Electron Spectra for Surface Analysis (SRD 100). Where possible, we make comparisons of the calculated EALs with illustrative experimental results. A key parameter in the EAL predictive equations is the so-called albedo, a useful measure of the strength of elastic-scattering effects in a material. The albedo is a simple function of the IMFP and the transport mean free path (TRMFP). We provide a tabulation of albedo and TRMFP values in the supplementary material for 41 elemental solids and 42 inorganic compounds for photoelectron energies between 50 eV and 30 keV. For other materials, albedo values can be determined from IMFP and TRMFP data available in the NIST SRD 82 and SRD 100 databases.},

The \textregistered rst reviews the electrical properties of semiconductor surfaces and the second discusses SPV phenomena. Next, the most common tools for SPV measurements and their relative advantages and disadvantages are reviewed. These include the Kelvin probe and the use of MIS structures, as well as other less used techniques. Recent novel high-spatial-resolution SPV measurement techniques are also presented. Applications include surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) which is a very effective tool for gap state spectroscopy. An in-depth review of quantitative analyses, which permit the extraction of various important surface and bulk parameters, follows. These analyses include: carrier diffusion length; surface band bending, charge, and dipole; surface and bulk recombination rates; surface state distribution and properties; distinction between surface and bulk states; spectroscopy of thin \textregistered lms, heterostructures and quantum structures; and construction of band diagrams. Finally, concluding remarks are given. \# 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {All-optical magnetic state switching Magneto-optical memory storage media, such as hard drives, use magnetic fields to change the magnetization of memory bits, but the process is slow. Light can often reveal information about the magnetization state of a sample, such as its field direction. Lambert et al. show that under the right circumstances, light can also switch the magnetization state of a thin ferromagnetic film. Using light pulses instead of magnetic fields led to ultrafast data memory and data storage. Science, this issue p. 1337 The interplay of light and magnetism allowed light to be used as a probe of magnetic materials. Now the focus has shifted to use polarized light to alter or manipulate magnetism. Here, we demonstrate optical control of ferromagnetic materials ranging from magnetic thin films to multilayers and even granular films being explored for ultra-high-density magnetic recording. Our finding shows that optical control of magnetic materials is a much more general phenomenon than previously assumed and may have a major impact on data memory and storage industries through the integration of optical control of ferromagnetic bits. The all-optical control of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films is demonstrated. The all-optical control of magnetization in thin ferromagnetic films is demonstrated.},

Relatively smooth island surfaces can be obtained by deposition around 160\textdegree C, however, the island heights distribution is rather irregular then. The rms roughness is lowest for deposition at l l0\textdegree C. At lower deposition temperatures the islands become more round-shaped, likely due to a reduction of step edge diffusion. Post-deposition annealing to temperatures around 210\textdegree C increases the overall variation of the island height distribution.},

In this work, soft x-ray photoemission electron microscopy was utilized to image AFM domains in micromagnets patterned into La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 (LSFO) thin films and La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/LSFO superlattices. A delicate balance exists between magnetocrystalline anisotropy, shape anisotropy, and exchange interactions such that the AFM domain structure can be controlled using parameters such as LSFO and LSMO layer thickness, micromagnet shape, and temperature. In LSFO thin films, shape anisotropy gains importance only in micromagnets where at least one extended edge is aligned parallel to an AFM easy axis. In contrast, in the limit of ultrathin LSFO layers in the LSMO/LSFO superlattice, shape anisotropy effects dominate such that the AFM spin axes at micromagnet edges can be aligned along any in-plane crystallographic direction.},

  abstract = {Magnetoplasmonic crystals are spatially periodic nanostructured magnetic surfaces combining the features of surface plasmon polariton excitation and magneto-optical tunability. Here we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical work demonstrating that in magnetoplasmonic crystals the coupling of free space radiation to surface plasmon polariton modes in conjunction with the inherent magnetooptical activity, enable cross-coupling of propagating surface plasmon polariton modes. We have explored the consequences of this unique magnetoplasmonic crystal optical feature by studying the light reflected from a two-dimensional periodic array of cylindrical holes in a ferromagnetic layer illuminated at oblique incidence and magnetized in the sample plane, namely, in the so-called longitudinal Kerr effect geometry. We observe that the magneto-optical spectral response arises from all the excitable surface plasmon polariton modes in the magnetoplasmonic crystal irrespective of the incoming light polarization. We show that this is a direct consequence of the magneto-optically mediated coupling of propagating surface plasmon polariton modes. We demonstrate that a large enhancement of the longitudinal Kerr effect is induced when special noncollinear surface plasmon polariton modes, which couple to both p- and s-polarized light, are resonantly excited. We show how the resonant enhancement of the Kerr effect can be set at desired radiation wavelengths and incidence angles by precise plasmonic band engineering achievable through the proper design of the magnetoplasmonic lattice structure. Our findings, besides clarifying the underlying physics that governs the peculiar magneto-optical properties of magnetoplasmonic crystals, open a path to the design of novel active metamaterials with tailored and enhanced magneto-optical activity.},

  abstract = {For many decades CMOS devices have been successfully scaled down to achieve higher speed and increased performance of integrated circuits at lower cost. Today's charge-based CMOS electronics encounters two major challenges: power dissipation and variability. Spintronics is a rapidly evolving research and development field, which offers a potential solution to these issues by introducing novel `more than Moore' devices. Spin-based magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) is already recognized as one of the most promising candidates for future universal memory. Magnetic tunnel junctions, the main elements of MRAM cells, can also be used to build logic-in-memory circuits with non-volatile storage elements on top of CMOS logic circuits, as well as versatile compact on-chip oscillators with low power consumption. We give an overview of CMOS-compatible spintronics applications. First, we present a brief introduction to the physical background considering such effects as magnetoresistance, spin-transfer torque (STT), spin Hall effect, and magnetoelectric effects. We continue with a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art spintronic devices for memory applications (STT-MRAM, domain wallmotion MRAM, and spin\textendash orbit torque MRAM), oscillators (spin torque oscillators and spin Hall nano-oscillators), logic (logic-in-memory, all-spin logic, and buffered magnetic logic gate grid), sensors, and random number generators. Devices with different types of resistivity switching are analyzed and compared, with their advantages highlighted and challenges revealed. CMOScompatible spintronic devices are demonstrated beginning with predictive simulations, proceeding to their experimental confirmation and realization, and finalized by the current status of application in modern integrated systems and circuits. We conclude the review with an outlook, where we share our vision on the future applications of the prospective devices in the area.},

The method is based on placing shorting planes above and below the surface along which the surface polaritons and/or guided wave polaritons propagate. The presence of these shorting planes renders the electromagnetic modes of the resulting closed waveguide discrete, and they provide a convenient basis in which to expand the reflected and transmitted fields, as well as the volume electromagnetic field in the region above the surface.},

A high numerical aperture objective focusses beams of various wavelengths onto samples of different sub-wavelength thicknesses made of several opaque and pure materials. The standard evaluation of the experimental data shows material and sample dependent spatial shifts of the reconstructed intensity distribution, where the orientation of the electric field with respect to the edge plays an important role. A deeper understanding of the interaction between the knife-edge and the incoming highly focused beam is gained in our theoretical model by considering eigenmodes of the metal-insulator-metal structure. We achieve good qualitative agreement of our numerical simulations with the experimental findings.},

In addition to the excitation of spin precession, we discuss examples of rapid cooling and the control of ultrafast coherent longitudinal spin dynamics in response to femtosecond optically induced perturbations of exchange interactions. These elucidate the potential for exploiting the control of exchange interactions to find new scenarios for both faster and more energy-efficient manipulation of magnetism.},

  abstract = {We present LEED structure determinations of ultra-thin epitaxial Ni films on Cu(001) for coverages of 3, 5 and 11 ML. From full dynamical intensity analyses, a tetragonal distortion of all films can be deduced, in good accordance with FMR results. The structural parameters of the 5 and 11 ML films are practically identical. So, obviously there are no structural changes at about 7 ML, where the orientation of the magnetization is reported to switch from in-plane to out-of-plane. The film growth is pseudomorphic with an in-plane lattice parameter ap =2.53 ,\textasciitilde{} at coverages of 3 and 5 ML. This value, which is slightly reduced with respect to the copper bulk, was recently also found to produce the best fit for a similarly prepared clean Cu(100) surface. With further increasing coverage, ap tends to approach the value of the nickel bulk (2.49 A) but does not fully reach it even at 11 ML (ap =2.51 A). The films at 5 and 11 ML (and probably also in the regime between) show considerable tetragonal distortions. The top Ni layer shows an outward relaxation of 8\% relative to the distances between deeper layers, which, due to the tetragonal distortion, are reduced compared to the ideal value of the nickel bulk.},

  abstract = {This work enlightens the threshold photoemission magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and its adaption on photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) using lasers. MCD is a simple and efficient way to investigate magnetic properties since it does not need any spin analyzers with low efficiency, and thus the MCD related techniques have developed to observe magnetic domains. Usually, MCD in a total yield measurement in the valence band with weak spin\textendash orbit coupling (SOC) excited by low photon energy (h {$\leq$} 6 eV) does not compete with the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) with strong SOC. XMCD PEEM observation of magnetic domains has been successfully established while MCD PEEM derived from valence bands has not been. However, using angle and energy resolved photoelectron, valence band MCD provides large asymmetry similar to that by XMCD. Threshold measurement of photoelectron in a total electron yield procedure can take advantage of the measurement of photoelectrons with a limited angle and energy mode. This restriction of the photoelectron makes the threshold MCD technique an efficient way to get magnetic information and gives more than 10\% asymmetry for Ni/Cu(0 0 1), which is comparable to that obtained by angle resolved photoemission. Thus the threshold MCD technique is a suitable method to observe magnetic domains by PEEM. For threshold MCD, incident angle dependence and high sensitivity to out-of-plane magnetized films compared with in-plane ones are discussed. Ultrashort pulse lasers make it feasible to measure two photon photoemission MCD combined with PEEM, where resonant excitation has a possibility to enhance dichroic asymmetry. Recent results for valence band magnetic dichroism PEEM are presented.},

It is generally accepted that magnetization reversal should be driven by a stimulus represented by time-non-invariant vectors such as a magnetic field, spin-polarized electric current, or cross-product of two oscillating electric fields. However, until now it has been generally assumed that heating alone, not represented as a vector at all, cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization, although it may assist this process. Here we show numerically and demonstrate experimentally a novel mechanism of deterministic magnetization reversal in a ferrimagnet driven by an ultrafast heating of the medium resulting from the absorption of a sub-picosecond laser pulse without the presence of a magnetic field.},

Besides, if the period of a grating is larger than 8 times the wavelength but the slit width or the size of the opaque portion of the grating is close to the wavelength, diffraction of the grating also becomes polarization dependent.},

Whereas silver is often the material of choice due to its exceptional low plasma frequency and weak damping, similar observations have not been reported for ferromagnetic metals. In this work, we report on propagating SPPs on Ni80Fe20 microstructures imaged by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) in combination with a tunable femtosecond laser system at MHz repetition rate. Circular dichroic (CD) images in threshold PEEM show clear edge-induced SPPs with sub-micrometer wavelength and propagation length of about 3.5 {$\mu$}m. Analysis of the interference patterns as well as the coupling of the optical spin angular momentum to the observed fringe fields reveal propagation characteristics exclusive to evanescent waves and the presence of the plasmonic spin-Hall effect. Our work provides direct evidence that many materials with a high plasma frequency allow for excitation and observation of propagating SPPs at the dielectric/metal interface via CD PEEM imaging, enabling magnetoplasmonic investigation of common ferromagnets on nanometer length and femtosecond time scales.},

Here we focus on a theoretical description of the many-body dynamical electronic response of solids, which underlines the existence of various collective electronic excitations at metal surfaces, such as the conventional surface plasmon, multipole plasmons and the recently predicted acoustic surface plasmon.

  abstract = {Since the emission of secondary electrons for any incident energy always involves the formation and emission of a cascade of slow electrons ({$<$}50 eV) the secondary electron yield (SEY) for arbitrary energies depends sensitively on the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) values at low energies (below 100 eV). This makes it possible to retrieve the information about the low energy IMFP from high energy SEY experiments. A Monte Carlo (MC) code has been developed to simulate SEY values and was employed to determine the IMFP at low energies ({$<$}100 eV). This is done by varying the energy dependence of the IMFP at low energies ({$<$}100 eV) during the MC simulation of the SEY between two extremes, calculated on the basis of the Mermin dielectric function and the Penn algorithm within the simplified single-pole approximation (SSPA). Those IMFP values that give the best {$\chi$}2 fit of the simulated SEY values with experimental results are considered to be the most reliable. The described algorithm was employed for the investigation of Be, Al, Si, Ti, V, Fe, Ni, Cu, Ge, Nb, Mo, Pd, Ag, Ta, W, Pt, Au. For most materials these optimum IMFP values are found to be close to IMFP values based on the Mermin dielectric function.},

We use photoemission electron microscopy to map the spatial distribution of the electric near-field on a nanopatterned magnetic surface that supports plasmon polaritons. By using different photon energies and polarization states of the incident light we reveal that the electric near-field is either concentrated in spots forming a hexagonal lattice with the same symmetry as the Ni nanopattern or in stripes oriented along the {$\Gamma-$}K direction of the lattice and perpendicular to the polarization direction. We show that the polarization-dependent near-field enhancement on the patterned surface is directly correlated to both the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons on the patterned surface as well as the enhancement of the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect. We obtain a relationship between the size of the enhanced magnetooptical behavior and the polarization and wavelength of optical excitation. The engineering of the magneto-optic response based on the plasmon-induced modification of the optical properties introduces the concept of a magneto-plasmonic meta-structure.},

  abstract = {Background: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. Results: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called ``ImageJ2'' in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Conclusions: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

Iron oxidation proceeds through the formation of FeO (Fe2+) followed with Fe2O3 growth (Fe3+). The oxidation is governed by a dissociative Langmuir-type oxidation: the sticking coefficient is decreasing over oxygen exposure. Oxidation continues by oxygen dissolution into the first layers to form a nano-oxide of about 8 \AA{} in thickness.},

  abstract = {The imaging of surfaces by means of photoexcitation electron emission microscopy (PEEM) has recently received considerable interest. This is mainly due to the extended use and availability of brilliant synchrotron radiation in the soft x-ray regime which generally facilitates studies with surface specificity and chemical selectivity. The most popular application of the x-ray PEEM (XPEEM) technique concerns studies of magnetic systems and phenomena. By exploiting the high degree of circular or linear polarization of the synchrotron light, the magnetic microstructure in both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets can be visualized. In this contribution we demonstrate the unique potential and the versatility of the PEEM approach, and review the current status with a certain emphasis on experiments with soft x-ray excitation. In some cases, the high-energy excitation studies can be complemented by laboratory experiments employing threshold photoemission with ultraviolet light (UV-PEEM). Current limitations and future developments and perspectives of the PEEM technique applied to magnetic systems are discussed.},

The windowless lamp is differentially pumped and can be installed inside a vacuum chamber. During operation it is water cooled and can be mildly baked because it contains metal seals only. In a light beam of 2.5 mm diameter the photon flux for the strongest He1 and Ne1 emission line has been measured to be nearly I O L 3s - ' and one order of magnitude less for the strongest HeII, Ne11 and ArI lines. The photon intensities obtained are compared with values from the literature. The lamp has been used to investigate atomic and molecular photoionisation simultaneously resolved with respect to photon and electron energy. electron emission angle, and spin. To show the performance. angular-distribution results of photoelectron intensities for nitrogen molecules (X2C:. A211u,B'C:) at 58.43 nm are presented.},

Using the ratio adadas the only adjustable parameter, the model predicts the enhancement of the spin polarization of the low energy cascade electrons as well as a(x) in reasonable agreement with the existing observations on Fe, Co and Ni. A detector for electron spin polarization P based on the spin dependent transmission of electrons through ferromagnetic material is proposed which should be superior to existing P-detectors by 1-2 orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has proven to be a powerful analytical tool in surface science. In this contribution, a status report is given on the application of the PEEM technique in the investigation of surface and interface magnetism. Owing to its fast parallel image acquisition and its wide zoom range, allowing fields of view from almost 1 mm down to a few micrometres, combined with a high base resolution of the order of 20 nm, the method offers a unique access to many aspects in surface and thin-film magnetism on the mesoscopic length scale. There are three basically different modes of magnetic imaging using PEEM. The first one exploits the magnetic x-ray circular dichroism (MXCD) for contrast formation. It offers the important advantage of selecting the magnetic contrast of a certain element via the corresponding x-ray absorption edges using a tuneable x-ray source such as synchrotron radiation. This mode gives access to magnetic structures and coupling phenomena with a sensitivity in the submonolayer range and the capability to image the signal of buried layers with an information depth up to more than 5 nm. The two other modes work with simple UV light sources and are therefore highly attractive for standard laboratory applications. The magnetic stray-field-induced changes of the electron trajectories close to the sample surface lead to a Lorentz-type contrast. A third type of contrast arises as a consequence of the Kerr rotation of the dielectric vector inside a magnetic material, a phenomenon which is also responsible for the well known magneto-optical Kerr effect. Examples and typical applications of magnetic imaging using PEEM are discussed.},

In the spatiotemporal domain, imaging of fast processes by PEEM gives direct insight into plasmon dynamics or magnetization processes. In the category real space \& spin the novel concept of imaging spin filters is discussed. In the time \& spin chapter we address time-of-flight spin detectors and ultrafast spin processes that are accessible by pump-and-probe techniques. A main part of the paper is devoted to the resolution of momentum-space \& time. This is implemented in form of the time-of-flight momentum microscope, a very recent development of which the first instrument has been in operation since 2014. In an extended outlook chapter, the potential of new developments and of a novel, highly parallelized delay-line type electron detector will be discussed. The combination of all three degrees of freedom k-space, time \& spin is emerging through the combination of the ToF momentum microscope with imaging spin filter.},

Herein, we used peptides of differing secondary structures (random coil and R-helix) to artificially create optically active chiral gold nanoparticles through peptide-nanoparticle interactions as observed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. This interaction produces a CD signal at the plasmon resonance frequency ({$\sim$}520 nm) of the chiral peptide-nanoparticle complex. Aggregation of the peptide-coated nanoparticles using metal ions results in a red-shifted plasmonic CD response. Our results suggest that chiroptical properties of nanomaterials can be engineered using peptides.},

The nanoparticle formed a sphere with varying the diameter from 10 nm to 200 nm with increment 10 nm, and the medium of nanoparticles is air (1+0i). The calculation was carried out by metallic nanoparticle boundary element method package. Furthermore, our result shows that increasing diameter of particles (iron, nickel, and permalloy) would increase the efficiency of ratio scattering to absorption, and the LSPRs peak led to shift to lower energy (red-shift). The ratio of scattering to absorption indicates a strengthening of radiative damping in large particle-size which largely used for biological cell imaging. However, iron's efficiency much lower than nickel and permalloy. For example, at the highest diameter, such 200 nm, the efficiency of iron is just over around 1.25 while nickel and permalloy well under nearly 2.0. In addition, nickel and permalloy's LSPR happened in visible range. Our results serve a systematic understanding of the shifting spectrum pattern for prospective ferromagnetic materials.},

In order to model their response or tailor the optimal experimental parameters it is necessary to know the optical and magneto-optical properties of this material over a wide spectral range. We report on the systematic study of optical and magneto-optical properties of 10 nm and 150 nm thick permalloy films by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry and magneto-optical spectroscopy. To study the influence of the surface oxidization, the samples were prepared with and without Au capping layer. Spectral dependence of the complete permittivity tensor was derived from experimental data in a broad spectral range covering IR, visible and UV regions. All samples exhibited metallic-like optical and magneto-optical properties with clear differences in 10 nm thick bare sample. These differences to overall optical and magneto-optical properties of nanometer-thick permalloy layers were ascribed to a strong influence of the surface oxide.},

Characteristic patterns with large asymmetry have been observed experimentally. Upon heating the sample to temperatures significantly above the Ne\textasciiacute{} el temperature, the patterns clearly remain visible and a magnetic origin can therefore be excluded. The patterns probably originate in polishing damage, with the bright areas corresponding to areas with a high oxygen deficiency (with enhanced electron emission). After sputter cleaning the sample, thereby removing the dominant patterns, no significant asymmetries in electron emission remain. Obviously, for our samples the AF asymmetries as measured with threshold PEEM are less than the detection limits of our setup of 0.5\%. The conclusion is supported by model calculations, which show that the asymmetry should have a distinct angular dependence and which give an estimate of the maximum asymmetry of below 1\%.},

The overall layout of this article is unchanged, given that it has proved the most appropriate way to convey the most relevant aspects of today's magnetism research in a wide variety of sub-fields to a broad readership. A different group of experts has again been selected for this article, representing both the breadth of new research areas, and the desire to incorporate different voices and viewpoints. The latter is especially relevant for thistype of article, in which one's field of expertise has to be accommodated on two printed pages only, so that personal selection preferences are naturally rather more visible than in other types of articles. Most importantly, the very relevant advances in the field of magnetism research in recent years make the publication of yet another Magnetism Roadmap a very sensible and timely endeavour, allowing its authors and readers to take another broad-based, but concise look at the most significant developments in magnetism, their precise status, their challenges, and their anticipated future developments.             While many of the contributions in this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap edition have significant associations with different aspects of magnetism, the general layout can nonetheless be classified in terms of three main themes: (i) phenomena, (ii) materials and characterization, and (iii) applications and devices. While these categories are unsurprisingly rather similar to the 2017 Roadmap, the order is different, in that the 2020 Roadmap considers phenomena first, even if their occurrences are naturally very difficult to separate from the materials exhibiting such phenomena. Nonetheless, the specifically selected topics seemed to be best displayed in the order presented here, in particular, because many of the phenomena or geometries discussed in (i) can be found or designed into a large variety of materials, so that the progression of the article embarks from more general concepts to more specific classes of materials in the selected order. Given that applications and devices are based on both phenomena and materials, it seemed most appropriate to close the article with the application and devices section (iii) once again. The 2020 Magnetism Roadmap article contains 14 sections, all of which were written by individual authors and experts, specifically addressing a subject in terms of its status, advances, challenges and perspectives in just two pages. Evidently, this two-page format limits the depth to which each subject can be described. Nonetheless, the most relevant and key aspects of each field are touched upon, which enables the Roadmap as whole to give its readership an initial overview of and outlook into a wide variety of topics and fields in a fairly condensed format. Correspondingly, the Roadmap pursues the goal of giving each reader a brief reference frame of relevant and current topics in modern applied magnetism research, even if not all sub-fields can be represented here.             The first block of this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap, which is focussed on (i) phenomena, contains five contributions, which address the areas of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interactions, and two-dimensional and curvilinear magnetism, as well as spin-orbit torque phenomena and all optical magnetization reversal. All of these contributions describe cutting edge aspects of rather fundamental physical processes and properties, associated with new and improved magnetic materials' properties, together with potential developments in terms of future devices and technology. As such, they form part of a widening magnetism `phenomena reservoir' for utilization in applied magnetism and related device technology. The final block (iii) of this article focuses on such applications and device-related fields in four contributions relating to currently active areas of research, which are of course utilizing magnetic phenomena to enable specific functions. These contributions highlight the role of magnetism or spintronics in the field of neuromorphic and reservoir computing, terahertz technology, and domain wall-based logic. One aspect common to all of these application-related contributions is that they are not yet being utilized in commercially available technology; it is currently still an open question, whether or not such technological applications will be magnetism-based at all in the future, or if other types of materials and phenomena will yet outperform magnetism. This last point is actually a very good indication of the vibrancy of applied magnetism research today, given that it demonstrates that magnetism research is able to venture into novel application fields, based upon its portfolio of phenomena, effects and materials. This materials portfolio in particular defines the central block (ii) of this article, with its five contributions interconnecting phenomena with devices, for which materials and the characterization of their properties is the decisive discriminator between purely academically interesting aspects and the true viability of real-life devices, because only available materials and their associated fabrication and characterization methods permit reliable technological implementation. These five contributions specifically address magnetic films and multiferroic heterostructures for the purpose of spin electronic utilization, multi-scale materials modelling, and magnetic materials design based upon machine-learning, as well as materials characterization via polarized neutron measurements. As such, these contributions illustrate the balanced relevance of research into experimental and modelling magnetic materials, as well the importance of sophisticated characterization methods that allow for an ever-more refined understanding of materials. As a combined and integrated article, this 2020 Magnetism Roadmap is intended to be a reference point for current, novel and emerging research directions in modern magnetism, just as its 2014 and 2017 predecessors have been in previous years.},

  abstract = {Magnetic dichroism in angle-resolved UV photoemission is a simple extension of conventional photoemission experiments which is sensitive to the effects of spin-orbit coupling in itinerent electron ferromagnets which ultimately determine the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. A qualitative model of the magnetic dichroism arising from bulk-band transitions allows experiments to be interpreted with reference to widely available, approximate band-structure calculations which ignore spin-orbit coupling. Strong hybridization of initial state bands via spin-orbit coupling, gives a plus/minus feature in the dichroism, and (usually) corresponds to what is conventionally understood as magnetic dichroism in angular distribution (MDAD) of photoelectrons. Spin and parity mixing in time-reversed LEED photoelectron states, give rise to a feature of single sign in the dichroism, and (usually) correspond to what is conventionally understood as spin-dependent surface transmission. These results suggest that the technique can be used to follow the dispersion and hybridization of closely spaced initial state bands which are poorly resolved in conventional photoemission, and to infer the spatial symmetry and spin of the bands without recourse to sophisticated photoemission calculations. Under favourable conditions, the spin-orbit splitting or the exchange splitting of bands can be determined.},

  abstract = {Metal-oxide-based catalysts are used for many important synthesis reactions in the chemical industry. A better understanding of the catalyst operation can be achieved by studying elementary reaction steps on well-defined model catalyst systems. For the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of steam both unpromoted and potassium promoted iron-oxide catalysts are active. Here we review the work done over unpromoted single-crystalline FeO(1 1 1), Fe3O4\dh 1 1 1\TH{} and a-Fe2O3\dh 0 0 0 1\TH{} films grown epitaxially on Pt(1 1 1) substrates. Their geometric and electronic surface structures were characterized by STM, LEED, electron microscopy and electron spectroscopic techniques. In an integrative approach, the interaction of water, ethylbenzene and styrene with these films was investigated mainly by thermal desorption and photoelectron emission spectroscopy. The adsorption\textendash desorption energetics and kinetics depend on the oxide surface terminations and are correlated to the electronic structures and acid\textendash base properties of the corresponding oxide phases, which reveal insight into the nature of the active sites and into the catalytic function of semiconducting oxides in general. Catalytic studies, using a batch-reactor arrangement at high gas pressures and post-reaction surface analysis, showed that only a-Fe2O3\dh 0 0 0 1\TH{} containing surface defects is catalytically active, whereas Fe3O4\dh 1 1 1\TH{} is always inactive. This can be related to the elementary adsorption and desorption properties observed in ultrahigh vacuum, which indicates that the surface chemical properties of the iron-oxide films do not change significantly across the ``pressure-gap''. A model is proposed according to which the active site involves a regular acidic surface site and a defect site next to it. The results on metal-oxide surface chemistry also have implications for other fields such as environmental science, biophysics and chemical sensors. \'O 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {Using a unique momentum microscope, we measured energyresolved momentum distributions of valence-band electrons photoemitted into the whole half-space above the Cu(111) and Cu(001) surfaces. The experimental results are compared to one-step photoemission calculations. Convincing agreement between theoretical and experimental photoelectron momentum patterns can only be achieved by orbital-dependent corrections which emulate many-body self-energy effects in the electronic structure of Cu (Strocov et al 2002 Phys. Rev. B 66 195104). By the analysis of the Shockley surface state of Cu(111), we show that these self-energy corrections also affect the surface electronic structure in specific ways. We find that the Shockley surface state of Cu(111) is shifted differently in energy than the bulk states. As a consequence, the agreement between the theoretically calculated and the experimentally measured binding energy of this surface state is improved. Energy-resolved twodimensional valence-band photoelectron mapping provides an alternative means of determining self-energy values experimentally.},

  abstract = {A surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic excitation existing on the surface of a good metal. It is an intrinsically two-dimensional excitation whose electromagnetic field decays exponentially with distance from the surface. In the past, it was possible to study only the (far-field) scattered light produced by the interaction of surface polaritons with surface features. Only with the development of scanning near-field optical microscopy did it become possible to measure the surface polariton field directly in close proximity to the surface where the SPP exists. Here we overview the near-field studies of surface polaritons on randomly rough and nanostructured surfaces, theoretical models of SPP interaction with surface features, and SPP applications in novel photonic technologies. Surface polariton scattering, interference, backscattering, and localization will be discussed, as well as concepts of surface polariton optics and polaritonic crystals. Surface polaritons are finding an ever increasing number of applications in traditional domains of surface characterization and sensors as well as in newly emerging nano-photonic and optoelectronic technologies.},

High resolution PEEM magnetic images (down to 43.2 nm) were directly obtained on a (001)-oriented magnetic FePt film surface with a circularly-polarized light under normal incidence. Furthermore, a stepped Cr seeding layer was applied to induce the formation of large-area epitaxial FePt films with (001) and (111) two orientations, where MLD with large asymmetry was observed in the transition area of two phases. It demonstrates that DUV laser can be a powerful source for high resolution magnetic imaging in the laboratory in absence of synchrotron facilities.},

In such systems, nonlinear magneto-optical Kerr effect (nonlinear MOKE) plays an important role as a characterization method, and Surface Plasmons (SPs) work as catalyst to induce many new effects. Magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation (MSHG) is the major nonlinear magnetooptical process involved. The new effects include enhanced MSHG, controlled and enhanced magnetic contrast, etc. Nanostructures such as thin films, nanoparticles, nanogratings, and nanoarrays are critical for the excitation of SPs, which makes NMP an interdisciplinary research field in nanoscience and nanotechnology. In this review article, we organize recent work in this field into two categories: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) representing propagating surface plasmons, and localized surface plasmons (LSPs), also called particle plasmons. We review the structures, experiments, findings, and the applications of NMP from various groups.},

The required order of the harmonic is selected out by a single grating in the off-plane mount and focused on the sample in the ultrahigh vacuum chamber of the photoemission electron microscope. Using metal gold and copper samples, the spatial resolution is calibrated to be better than 50 nm and the energy resolution is calibrated to be better than 300 meV.
